Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue

Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playin' on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shinin' brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue

So many women wanna call me 'baby'
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and, uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and, uh
That's me, and you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings, the celly rings, I gotta go
You'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still, I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue

I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (Igh!)

Baby, oh, my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
"Heads high, kill 'em with it now!"
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker

And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World"
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"

Praise the lord, I was born to drive boat
Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Buried a million in the sand, by the clock tower
Before I die, take a hot shower
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset

By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot "Land the plane," on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin MAC-11s with the features

Smoke something, biatch!

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters (rats)
Roll with sinners — A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty?
Drop a hook and then I’ll probably cop an M3
Long knife ('chete), that’s in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they’ll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
With the CCM tacks, my feet are like Cassius
Smoke premium cabbage
Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Yo we 80,000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns, owls, Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers
Security guards with 9 berettas, pullin' up Volkswagen jettas
Causin' storms in sunny weather, in sunny whether, in sunny weather
 
 
 
 
Smoking fucking thanksgiving turkey bags man
Surgical procedures
Ben Johnson
You already know

Sign my name with the feather, tap dance under the full moon
Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep it truckin', searching all the nooks and crannies
No english muffin, streets are filled with crooks and trannies
Bam bam got a shooter like Lagassee
Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse
One hand driving, 3 gram smoking
2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking
Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger
Shorty loved the longitude, dealer bring a quarter through
Over fishing make the snapper less affordable
I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical
Like "do you want to have sex?", well bitch, it's obvious
Her name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia
She grew a bush like a baby plant
Still I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams
Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag
And then I serve at a private tasting
I got no time for wasting
Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation
And prime rib from LaFrieda carved at the blablablabla
Fuck, fucked my last word up cause I don't give a shit man
I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station but yo
Yo my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a… Fuck
Yo, my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
And she wearing a wedding dress, a special day
She said she finally met a man to take her breath away
Well naturally I'm jealous, because I'm lonely
At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli
My dad was right I shoulda listened when he told me
A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean-Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed
I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June
And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting
Demons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted
Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted
Or take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance
I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it
But yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it
I pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me

Drinking juice just like Jack LaLanne now
I'mma strike it rich any day now

Virtuoso on a keyboard

Tell the pilot land at Schiphol
Play the violin with dimples
Life's ironic and it's simple
Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink
Drive nice car, wear all green mink
First time I whacked off was a Penthouse
Roses in the bath at the penthouse
Billy Joel at the garden
Should I get a skybox or an '89 IROC?
It's always poppin' at the IHOP
Choke a pussy with his tie knot, it's my block
Chuck Knoblauch, spicy coconut curry from the Thai spot
I'm in a hurry, dumb jewelry
The verdict read from a hung jury
The doctor said that I was hung early
Skull curly, Larry, and Moe, I'll marry a ho
Only if the bitch look like Mari' Monroe
Twisted off the Jenkem, watching Iron Chef
The secret ingredient was lion's neck
Royal Blue-Cyber Tech

Stop talking, just go down, baby
Shit on my chest, shoot colors like a care bear
All year see me tan, hopping out the van
You wasn’t there, now you tryna show face
Fuck around, be a cold case

Remote control chains, promote dough for the veins
Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs
Eat steaks off a gold plate, stoned, listening to Coldplay

You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

Long knife by the spinal, built like a rhino
Push the 635 to the finals
Pearl white like what you sniffin’ in your sinus
The finest vaginas demolished by my dick
One year from Queens to the top
Cream of the crop, serve a fiend out my sock
Five minutes till they lean like the drop
Now they spinning through the furnace like the scene from The Rock
Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper
Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather
Now my beard look like Uday and Qusay
Play the pool on a cool day

Drop a little sauce on the beater
Zero to 60 in a Porsche like a cheetah
New York, I'm like Jeter, light Caesar
No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker
You get drugs for a good price
My price cheaper, guaranteed
My trunk snapping like a tambourine
Bodying these pussies with a camera team

Fucking drug shit
Do the drugs
Yeah
Yo

Straight from the depths of Queens.
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, then switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking
Raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick suck from Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms
4 in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Wasting my time, my thoughts are paced, untastable grace replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
This is nothing, we live & let die and roam the land
And you bluffing
You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy
Tailor-made rubber, Rubbermaid reliable
Never spill the soup
Rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court
Spin & shoot
Strong as Popeye dipping in the spinach too

Take my nuts out your mouth
Let me breathe for a minute please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You're on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine, free the mind, lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cuz I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper. Hit her in the pooper. Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower, make the pussy brand new
Ran through. Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox & burn her with the candle

And If there’s anything left after that I’ll cop a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates?
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted, trying to erase her name
No, I caught her cheating, her pussy didn’t feel the same
She was probably with one of the Broncos
Or LeBron so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up, nah
I can’t talk about that though…

Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer

Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest
Baby girl, you're wylin if you sniff this
You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets
Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand
Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam in the can
Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos
Eating tacos, higher than a opera note
We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics
I throw you in that armbar with the quickness
Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45. fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china
Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er
I hit the diner, the Carolina
Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder
Vagina splash like apple cider
So fuck your little 2 cents blue benz bitches jump like Harold Miner
I'm in the recliner, we traced like eye liner
And I escape like MacGyver
Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler
And lay up with a case of vodka
Get cake and prosper
Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra
Air you out, leave your face for pasta
Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster
Beige fox, 88 Clarks
Ladies identify gangsters' posture
I'm feeling like J Hoffa
 
 
 
 

Sittin' first class, feelin' like shit though
Starin' out the window with the mind of a schizo
Thinkin' if I jump, will I feel it when I hit the ground?

I wouldn't care if everybody's dead
It's why I keep the pump shotty layin' in the bed
Have a fuckin' sleepover with my weapons
My Rambo knife is eatin' nuggets with my Smith & Wesson
Shit, I made this out of nothin'
Damn, these ladies love me out in London
Laurenivici served the granulated onion
My mind is locked in a contaminated dungeon
Dog, what the fuck is with your mother?
She got one leg longer than the other
One eye through the shutter
Made the transition from weed to butter, like spring to summer
I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
 
 
 
 
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain inside the coupe
Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid
Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in Corona, bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu no ta pa mi, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert, can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
FILA jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going "Boom Shakalaka!" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, cuz
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco

Yeah, fuck the back talk
Save all that pussy shit for the cat walk
Now write your name 100 times on the blackboard
Just a white man excelling in a Black sport, like I'm Pistol Pete
You already know you a goner when I kiss your cheek
Lift your feet, like when your sister sweeps
Fine dining, drink water out the crystal creek
Straight from Queens rocking leathers like I'm Mr. Cheeks
Uhhhh, fly shit
Grown man shit
Do it one more time, fuck it
I'm good to go
Alright

Yo, I'm a wild freak, hit shorty where the child sleep
While her mother make soup with the cow feet
Shoulder pads and a leather, Beau Brummell
Hopping out the limo at the old Tunnel
Fuck sex on the beach, I want head in the streets
Spread bed on the feet
Lead on your cheek, the cadillac from 73
Aqua marine with a popular fiend, uhh
Big Bird, Farrington alumnus
Mouth like a pussy, she gum dick

You see me in the green velour, facial conquistador
Then I order up a feast for four
If you see me in a leather, know it's reaching the floor
Linen flapping in the wind cause of the breezy shore, yeah
Spinal tap, you spitting gynecology rap
Eat your pussy with a plastic bag, covering that
Brothers will clap leave you hovered or jacked
If there's chicken in the building, know I'm smothering that
This tool I got will loosen up your stool a lot
Near the pee pee will make you poo-poo a lot
In the Z3 bumping U2

Banging seven gram rocks and finishing them
Because that’s how I roll, I have one speed, I have one gear

Yeah, uh-huh
Feel the beat…

When our eyes first met, was like the fourth day in July
When you kissed my lips, I knew one day you'd be mine

One man team, about to win the pennant
Now you can tell by my pendant that I’m protected
Direct descendent in the blue and orange Lexus watching ‘Se7en'
Land in Dublin

I said no, they sent me on my way with blessings
I trained a dolphin to let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren

Orlando Magic warm-up suits and black Shaqs
'95: younger Bronson on the fast track
To blast gat, now I'm looking past that
I want the cash stack higher than the NASDAQ
I put the work in, the downtime I'm cooking lamb
A thousand Dutches in the air like it's a reefer jam

This is Queens Day, alleys where the fiends play
Yo cuff the Guess on the construction, take it easy
This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home, and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight, focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies

Bronsonelli the problem, we got the party reeking
Never see us starving, all my people hardly speaking
When it's time, though, we form into a single file
Spray the fucking ballcourt without hitting a single child
Hop in the Beamer, Pigeon popping the nina
Getting top in a steamer, scoping rock in a Tina
Hooker, that type of looker eat the pussy from the back
Take the children to the school, baking cookies, serving packs all day
Know the verbal, is Oscar-winning
You cop a squat to piss in, only focused on them rocks that glisten
Suppositories in the ass of you, the green Fila with a Horsey how this motherfucking bastard do

Through the eyes of a G

Yo
Through the eyes of a G
A-B, utilize what you and I use to see
To move forward
Cause I get bored with niggas talking 'bout
Who they used to be, what they used to do
My homie headed to court, not for a 2-on-2
Ironically, I'll have you know we do it for the sport
Or at least to keep a little gold in this uniform
I'm abnormal like a unicorn that you could get on
Cows jump over moons when my nouns and verbs move
Etiquette of a veteran, still getting checks
You get a F for your efforts, we never trade techs
I tried to keep the peace but now I gotta keep the piece
I speak in synchronistic frequency with triggers squeezing
And one day I'll drop to my knee and repent to Jesus
'Til then I'm humping my lust demons for no reason
Soul-o ho, from Del Amo to SoHo, ho
Yo, yo, check, "you do not know me, no, no, no
You do not know me but I know you-"

I'm about to buy a fucking Lion for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where I been?" don't worry
She said, "Baby, I crashed the Benz", don't worry

Dropkicks out the drop-top 6
Don't make your fucking kid become a hostage, I got this
Stay in the water like the Loch Ness
Shirtless rocking a locket
Drugs in my pocket
It's all for a profit
Aim it and pop it, drive in a range in my boxers
Lay in the tropics, my girl pussy red like a lobster
Orgies at Hofstra
My bank account is like a Polish doctor
My heart is cold, I sing a soldiers opera
My drugs as strong as Arnold
They found her dead in the gold Impala
Hanging backwards out the chopper
The room smell like Nag Champa
Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers

Yeah, I rhyme sick like I play with shit
I've driven every flavored whip there is to get
Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff
I should be on that Sped Ed bus, layin' on the bed with a red head slut
These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it
I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing Sega
Prince of Albania
No money, nothing to say to ya
I push the limo to the stadium
Game 7, Knicks-Heat
Me and Spike had to switch seats
Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet
Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet
Down in Mexico eating chilis


No emotions, lotions on the bed sheets
I saw her walking cause I'm stalking on the dead streets
Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet
She had a tight pink dress, her pussy was a weapon
Said she was a daughter of a Reverend
Well, thank god I don't believe in heaven
Butt cheeks sculpted like a horse's hind
Shit man, I think that I just crossed the line
Annual abortion time
Yeah, she got the tat straight from West 4th
Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off
And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough
Well I'm not a doctor, but I know that's not a good sign
Matter of time 'til she placed and laced in a wood pine
For years she was the hood slime
Now no longer having a good time
Under earth, she burst into a sudden birth
Oh shit, the facial of my cousin Murph
Strange occurrences, alignment with the sun and earth, yeah
As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning
Instinctively they heading towards the water cause they need it
Forever cycles stay the same, they feel it like a fiend's wrist
Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship
My mustache like a Colonel
Take a haters facial and I treat it like a urinal
A bit disturbed, confessions in a journal
 
 
 
 

Yo pass me the ball fool
You better fuckin' pick me, ya
Straight the fuck up, I roof this shit
Fuckin' 360 on this pussy
I don't give a fuck

No shoes on
I know you see me on the TV, lookin' like a hunk of beef
When I smile your baby mama shit her dungarees
Somebody get the kid a deal he sound like me
But nah, dunny don't get down like me
The falcon flies back to the glove when I whistle
Don't try to put me in the box like a tissue
Cause I push you in the box with a pink suit
Fuck around and have some squid ink soup, bitch
(Ah man there's so much fuckin' hash in this joint right now son)
Uh, you ain't a legend like Yanni
I'm so Queens like a Roy Wilkins T-shirt
With one arm shredded, and one arm missing
Dog, I was born with Allah's vision
I learned quick I couldn't follow suit
Cause the Devil put the pork inside the dollar soup
Now I'm sittin' in first class with a hard dick
Listenin' to German guitar riffs, what a life
I was made like the beginning of Jurassic Park
When they took the fucking blood from the mosquito with a dope needle
Then they shot it in a wild lion, 1983
I popped out holdin' an iron with a visor on
Yeah, uh huh

Hammer in the hamper 'case a nigga try to thug me
I'm a idol, my wave is tidal, forget survival
Treat the last record I broke just like a rival
Uh, I'm New York before it turned into a bike lane
Never had a light fame, split the pipe cane
It was written but I wrote it
Put religion right on my neck and then I froze it
Laurenovitch, yeah

3:36 in the morning
Location: a drug infested area, Brooklyn, New York
What am I doing? Standing on an unidentified corner
With a Latin individual, corn rows, foamposites;
All sorts of a felony in his waist
 
 
 
 
{Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me}
You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break north
Before you six south and I'll be sitting in that big house

Just let me sharpen my knives, thrown on the apron
X's mark the steak and the salad crumbled with bacon
And bleu cheese, caramel complexion's on two knees
Or two skis, carving up the Alps is what this dude needs
I'm Rick the Model, Martel to cartel
Live fast and eat the big tuna like Billy Parcells
No more child's play kid you with the big boys
Fuck an economy size, we want that big Royce
My family's sayin' that I rhyme with fury
Only focus on them hundred bill faces and suitcases that'll bribe a jury
Grind the curry never shine the jewelry
Pussy like it 86 style, you know it's fine and furry
Spark the bark in the park, you know, lumberyard
You ain't never in the limelight, undercard
Bronsolini in the sky, thunder rod
Commandante of this rap shit, young Mossad, killer
{Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me}
You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break north
Before you six south and I'll be sitting in that big house

The second stanza even deadly than the first
From the birth, I've been enlisted to plant seeds in the earth
That's soon, road to a valley that feeds, civilization
I'm walking the torrid land though I'm seeking my vindication from
My bad, I'll keep it fifth grade, keep the switchblade
Hilfiger sailin' apparel and plus a crisp fade
First day class, the Agassis are black and white
My older cousin puffing pot bitch, pass the pipe
Now I'm a certified user, more like abuser
Slice and dice the music I'm fluid like the yakuza
Or Sanders whether Deion or Barry, find candy
Though I smoke until my eyes are the shape of Tia Carrere
My team we work as a unit, nobody hog the ball up
Great intuition and vision, no time to hit the mall up
Just a taste of the life like a September call up
Johnnie Walker in our tall cup, getting torn up
Listen, I'm steel fisted with the iron lung
Heavy metal ballads out the guitar where lions run
Praise the son that can stand on his own two
Smoke on the big blunt, take a sip of this home-brew

She had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have
Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what
Make this fucking bitch sit in vinegar
Apple cider baths
Sit in the vinegar
Bronsolino
PS

Yo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone
You're a constant, fucked you in the school closet
We were young then, experimental periods
Laid a towel cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love, but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head
.25 out the pussy and it spits lead
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace

But I'mma to do what I gotta do
Trying to make this french dough like a Pâte à Choux
Over your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed
Smoking Ethiopian red
The son rose, a single teardrop fallopians bled
Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed
It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain
I keep the weiner on display for the campaign

I'm just doing what I had to do
Tryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going
To the top till I fall just like Owen
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak
 
 
 
 
So give me that reason
I told you I loved you already, bitch, what the fuck?

Shawl neck on the drunk lawyer

All I really want to do is see my people up
Up to no good again
She threw the condom told me put it in
I did, fuck
I nutted in like three strokes
Shit, now that’s no way to rep the East Coast
Every day I’m walking with my head up
Don’t let up ‘cause it’s a set-up

The bath was 90 degrees
Tapping Heinies with ease (shit,)
Bitch please I’m the bee’s knees

Uh, sharp instruments to rock like a fossil
Shotty for the haters, that's trimmed off at the nostrils
Well, me and Docker eating dinner at the brothel
Never sniff that blanco, that's word to OJ's Bronco
Cop a Dutch and break it open, overfill it
I'm rollin' in the car, it may be shaky, never spill it, though
Cause when I rhyme, I feel possessed by El Espirito
Encounters of a Third Kind, X-Rays on the visual
Ginger ale and hot sauce, two things I live by
I'm such a chill guy, but fuck around and, yes, you will die

The piggies saying freeze, but every time they did I chose to run
Takin' that attachment on the nozzle like a soldier's gun
Hide behind the boulder, silver bullet through you shoulder, son
Crack the pepper over thin crust that's handmade
I'm stayin' strapped just like the Air Raid
Yo, take a taste of my nuts
Know they sweet just like the candy
Dick is the same color as Band-Aid, understand me?
I built this building, they came and then I conquered
Two hour flights to Heathrow up in the Concorde
Fermented grapes up in my glass that bear the same name

I need a chick to hide the hammer in her asshole
I need that first class dough

It's me, Big Body
Who the fuck else?
You gotta pardon my absence, man
I just came back off of vacay, man
Just spent the whole fucking weekend up in Orchard Beach
Livin' the fucking life
I was out there wildin'
Had your moms on the motherfuckin' boogie board
Doing all types of stunts
But now I'm back though, ain't shit changed
Just came back, check my motherfuckin' emails
Got more motherfuckin' deals on the table
Don't even know what the fuck to do now
Shit
(Okay) Oh my God (Okay)
You can still see me though
Out there on Fulton Street, three in the mornin'
Bench pressin' a fiend
Ain't shit changed, still loiterin'

Now, I'm backtrackin' and hash rappin' with Action
Throwin' hand grenades at paddywagons in passin'
Old fashioned soul grabber snortin' all the coke up
The type of shit to turn a World War into a Polka
Polo'd up, the double RL icon (Yup)
Steppin' out the limo, tuxedos made of python
Listenin' to Lionel Richie, fuckin' with the lights on (Ooh)
Rice on the table, have us goin' all night long (Again, and again, and again)
Rooftops, sippin' on some red wine
Start to realize I've been trippin', shit is just fine (Okay)
So, I read a passage out the Bible as I take a bath
Dry off, hit the Colosseum on Jamaica Ave (Yep)
'Bout to say, "Fuck it," and form a union
 
 
 
 
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(I needed a little taste to that)

Twisting joints like a contortionist
Laid in the Porsche
My father driving
Days been sunny since I started rhyming
No denying me; I'm known to keep a fresh foot like podiatry
Nobody high as me
Green Timbs, in Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn
At the same time, fellatio from three twins
Those are triplets; I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it
Then they laughed, and ate brisket, fuck!
On my behalf, he had a meeting at the Neptune
Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom
Guns drawn like my bath by my lady friend
Mesothelioma money: drop Mercedes-Benz
And I ain't never left, you know I'm still here
Spit the shit to bring a cripple out the wheelchair
Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case
Long as she got big nipples and a tan face
Jungle Rule - can't be no fool
(Yeah, you're in the concrete right now)
Devil is on the loose, no coop

Foul living like Sandusky and Paterno
I've been husky, motherfuckers couldn't touch me
'Lo rugby with an Asian model so ugly
Celebration 1987, no bubbly
Facially, I'm like a young John Kennedy
More obscenity; EBT in Genovese
Go to Ock, get 70 for 100

All I see is C-notes, silk shirts at the casino
It's time to take those leather pants off, this ain't no dance off
I know your hands soft, you're on the menu like the lamb broth
This is a grown man's sport
And, dog, I leave a motherfucker laid out on the handball court
I never brag and boast, I'm fire out the dragon's nose
My words pronounced just like a camel toe
And every whip in the garage laced
Keep that thing in the guitar case, bait the cops into a car chase
Crash the mother fucking Jeep into the venue
You better pray to God it's straight to Heaven where they send you
Ah, why the fuck would I have a bodyguard
If I look just like the mother fucking bodyguard
Baby hair curls on my forehead, leave your whore dead
Hop out that four times, four door and draw lead
I'm underground and I need more bread
And I need more head from some bitches straight from Morehead
State your business cause I'm busy tanning naked
My joint is shaking while I'm wearing bracelets

05' pounds in the Laredo, they gotta get there today though
Ain’t no time for tryna lay low, bay bro
If you can’t do it all you gotta do is say no
I’ll take it from there, Ace is on Grand ready to work it
Displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thank science that nothing popped off, since I was young, had a lust for foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that red thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I’m gonna do this
Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?

Fly Mary in to sing to that cow before we slaughtered it
And then I ordered it

Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that
Laid by the pool, my legs gettin' massaged by a professional
Strictly business, nothin' sexual
Seasonal vegetables lookin' exceptional

Like I never wore makeup, and I'm ready for the spotlight
You know I got my hoodie on, and it's such a hot night
Shit I'm straight from Queens, catch me in the limo like it's prom night

Don't say a word to me

A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better, you better save that

With the jammy, a day before I have to go to Spain
Livin' on the edge, different colored women in my bed
Different, different colored linens on my leg
My mother said I better win or else she'll fuck me up
Ma we did it, I love you, you lucky slut
Since I was young I had the husky gut
But I'm gorgeous, got money in the pouch just like a tourist
Swerve in a Skylark, big piece of the pie chart

He told me, "Don't even worry about that shit, Body. I'll make that go away
Now what's for lunch?" I told him, don't worry, I got the hookup

And you there for smokin' weed

I'm by the bar lookin' Swedish in the trenchcoat stupid
The only one drinkin' mango lassi in the bullpen
My lips are sealed like the singer with bad skin
My need for speed made the Jag spin
Dog, I'll resurrect Freaky Tah to do my ad-libs
Overseas I prolly got mad kids

Nothin' lasts forever, or does it? Fuck it
Shout out to my cousins, all of 'em
I got a brand new car

Dippin' cabs and hoppin' fences

Got to the door, twist the key, elevator waitin' for me
100, got upstairs and fixed eleven bowls of Crispix
Grabbed a Snapple out the bin, no one's an even match for the kid
Legs are made of stone, the back of a bridge
In goal line situations I'll tackle the fridge

Hanging on the shoulder of a villain
She could flatten a village
You know I'm usually chilling out with Bruce Willis
Somehow, you and my man met first
I was still stealing the money outta my gram-gram's purse
But you were
Running the streets, letting the blam-blam work
Back then we smoked nickels of dirt
Nowadays it ain't shit to drop a grip on dessert
And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts
Fuck it, so be it, you 'bout to know Jesus
Turn this motherfucker back into a fetus
Phone's tapped so speak Swedish when you call the crib
Rich forever motherfucker I was born to live
Die happy, knowing that my family's straight
I hope they didn't see the numbers on that Camry plate

My whole life is a fucking discography, B
You stupid? Quadruple platinum
 
 
 
 
When I’m alone
Smoking weed, sitting by the window in my home
Often thinking why the fuck is it I’m not in Rome
If I had a little motivation, money, and a hot body
I see it now, Bronson, the heart-throbby
No more pigging out, binging on the late night
No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the game tight
No more pack of hot dogs on my neck right by the fade right
40 pounds to go and then you hookers getting laid right
I’m eating salad but I’m leaving off the croutons
'Cause ever since a youth your dog's huskier than UConn
Savings on the cookies, mommy clipping out the coupons
Passing out from over-eating, sleeping on the futon
Lock the refrigerator, there’s no controlling me
Steak and chocolate got they muthafuckin hold on me

From philly cheesesteaks, lobsters on the barbeque
I’m getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute
An hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer
Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer
Every five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened
Sneak a cookie, rip the bag, and fix the plastic wrapping
I don’t want know one to know that I took it
Cause I'm an over-eater (Ay yo ock, ay yo ock, fry the mayonnaise for me, man)
Life is a smorgasbord to me and I’ma over do it
I wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don’t cut it
Not the type that show the package with the crystal studded
