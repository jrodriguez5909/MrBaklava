Baby Blue Lyrics
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue

Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playin' on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shinin' brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue

So many women wanna call me 'baby'
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and, uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and, uh
That's me, and you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings, the celly rings, I gotta go
You'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still, I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue

I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early twenties
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (Igh!)

Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue

Actin’ Crazy Lyrics

Yeah, uh, opportunity be knockin', let a motherfucker in

Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby
All my life I was a fuck-up, now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us
See me hangin' out the window, screamin', "What, what?!"
No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby, oh, my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
"Heads high, kill 'em with it now!"
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker
With Anita Baker, uh

Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?

Uh, I feel so alive, I think I shit myself
I should kiss myself
I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror
The reflection shows a wolf though (AOOOH!)
Goddamn, I'm still cute, ho (Yeah)
All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World"
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"

Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?

Easy Rider Lyrics
Praise the lord, I was born to drive boat
Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Buried a million in the sand, by the clock tower
Before I die, take a hot shower
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset

By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen

Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot "Land the plane," on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin MAC-11s with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya
(I can't hear ya)
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya

Bird On A Wire LyricsLa musica de Harry Fraud
Smoke something, biatch!

Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters (rats)
Roll with sinners — A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty?
Drop a hook and then I’ll probably cop an M3
Long knife ('chete), that’s in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they’ll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
With the CCM tacks, my feet are like Cassius
Smoke premium cabbage
Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich

Yo we 80,000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns, owls, Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers
Security guards with 9 berettas, pullin' up Volkswagen jettas
Causin' storms in sunny weather, in sunny whether, in sunny weather
Hopin' that my days get, hopin', hopin' days get, days get betterYou might also like26Embed
 
 
 
 
9-24-11 Lyrics
Smoking fucking thanksgiving turkey bags man
Surgical procedures
Ben Johnson
You already know

Sign my name with the feather, tap dance under the full moon
Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep it truckin', searching all the nooks and crannies
No english muffin, streets are filled with crooks and trannies
Bam bam got a shooter like Lagassee
Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse
One hand driving, 3 gram smoking
2 fiend sucking, tea bag soaking
Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger
Shorty loved the longitude, dealer bring a quarter through
Over fishing make the snapper less affordable
I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical
Like "do you want to have sex?", well bitch, it's obvious
Her name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia
She grew a bush like a baby plant
Still I ate it, just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams
Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag
And then I serve at a private tasting
I got no time for wasting
Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation
And prime rib from LaFrieda carved at the blablablabla
Fuck, fucked my last word up cause I don't give a shit man
I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station but yo
Yo my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a… Fuck
Yo, my mind is locked up, my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
And she wearing a wedding dress, a special day
She said she finally met a man to take her breath away
Well naturally I'm jealous, because I'm lonely
At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli
My dad was right I shoulda listened when he told me
A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean-Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh yo
Pain within running deeper than the ocean floor
Ocean avenue, the family straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed
I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June
And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting
Demons on the doorstep, lungs that feel constricted
Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted
Or take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance
I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it
But yo, that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it
I pop the bottle of the moet, yo here's to me

Late nights I'm trying to stay up out of the orange skips
Great white sharks, the .38 with tarnished tip
27 years I never met an honest bitch
Slice their faces like Kitana and shit
Through my nasal blow the smoke
Basil on the boat
Hookers on the half shell, hundred dollar pants
Wind breaker jacket flapping like a falcon from a westward wind
Play the kitchen like a mexican, next of kin
Patrick Swayze… We out!

Terry Lyrics
Don't hurt me again
Uh, don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again, baby
Nah

What up, love? I need a hug cause drugs be takin' over
Shorty couldn't take it no more, she went loca
No stranger to a rum and soda
I met the ho while she was slumped over
Shit, I've been good, though, I can't complain
I could probably cop a half a plane
Drinking juice just like Jack LaLanne now
I'mma strike it rich any day now
Uh, you know I gotta get a plate now
Virtuoso on a keyboard
I rep the eastern seaboard, jeez Lord
Please leave the Z3 keys before you leave
Don't sneeze on my shit, cause for shiz I'mma flip ya
Pedicured foot slide in the slipper
Tryna do the remix with Pitbull
Tell the pilot land at Schiphol
Play the violin with dimples
Life's ironic and it's simple
Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink
Drive nice car, wear all green mink
First time I whacked off was a Penthouse
Roses in the bath at the penthouse
Billy Joel at the garden
Should I get a skybox or an '89 IROC?
It's always poppin' at the IHOP
Choke a pussy with his tie knot, it's my block
Chuck Knoblauch, spicy coconut curry from the Thai spot
I'm in a hurry, dumb jewelry
The verdict read from a hung jury
The doctor said that I was hung early
Skull curly, Larry, and Moe, I'll marry a ho
Only if the bitch look like Mari' Monroe
Twisted off the Jenkem, watching Iron Chef
The secret ingredient was lion's neck
Royal Blue-Cyber Tech
I ride solo like a fighter jet
Hurt me again
No, don't hurt me again
Please, don't hurt me again
No, don't hurt me again
There's no hit records on a demo
There's no hit records on a demo
No, don't hurt me again
There's no hit records on a demo
There's no hit records on a demo
Catch me hoppin' out the limo
Catch me hoppin' out the limo

Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink
Drive nice car, wear all green mink
Uh, what you payin'?
Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink
Drive nice car, wear all green mink
Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink
Drive nice car, wear all green mink

Strictly 4 My Jeeps Lyrics
Better slow down baby
I’m out here wildin'
Better slow down baby
Shit is crazy

You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby
Shit on my chest, shoot colors like a care bear
All year see me tan, hopping out the van
You wasn’t there, now you tryna show face
Fuck around, be a cold case
Chrome skates on an old day
Remote control chains, promote dough for the veins
Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs
Eat steaks off a gold plate, stoned, listening to Coldplay

You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

Long knife by the spinal, built like a rhino
Push the 635 to the finals
Pearl white like what you sniffin’ in your sinus
The finest vaginas demolished by my dick
One year from Queens to the top
Cream of the crop, serve a fiend out my sock
Five minutes till they lean like the drop
Now they spinning through the furnace like the scene from The Rock
Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper
Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather
Now my beard look like Uday and Qusay
Play the pool on a cool day

You never let the hammer off, you got the soft hands
I hear you singing for the boss man, dog
I’m from a lost land, spill coke on the heater
Drop a little sauce on the beater
Zero to 60 in a Porsche like a cheetah
New York, I'm like Jeter, light Caesar
No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker
You get drugs for a good price
My price cheaper, guaranteed
My trunk snapping like a tambourine
Bodying these pussies with a camera team
Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
You better slow down, baby
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby

White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds

Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with, never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with that dropkick, Marty Jannetty
Rock this Shawn Kemp, kamikaze
Burning cheese, Saganaki (opa)
Greek shit, whole team sick
Hoe bitches from Cleveland on my dick because I rap
Fuck it, make it clap
Throw the money in the air then pick it up
I'll take that back, bitch
Homie hold me down
Homie throw me phony pounds
The scent of dollars like some crispy garlic golden brown
Addicted but ain't nothing prescripted
Baby clams from Montauk, mix it up with the linguistics
Bitch I'm high
White leather to the knee, we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man, we known for using chopsticks

When they see me they non-vocal
High as fuck I need bifocals
Kush got me moving slo-mo
Steak and eggs in my dojo
It's some Gs in there
Need some weed? I'm there
All these cars I own, ain't no keys in there
Tapping young niggas out, rolling weed out an ounce
Now I got a bigger crib
Repping what I live about
My hair long, my weed strong, so they staring
My weed strong, my money long, I ain't caring

Consensual Rape Lyrics
Fucking drug shit
Do the drugs
Yeah
Yo

Straight from the depths of Queens.
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln, then switch into a desert scene
Often heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking
Raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks, dick suck from Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms
4 in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Wasting my time, my thoughts are paced, untastable grace replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around, put the knife in your back
This is nothing, we live & let die and roam the land
And you bluffing
You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy
Tailor-made rubber, Rubbermaid reliable
Never spill the soup
Rock a linen suit
Play the streets like the ball court
Spin & shoot
Strong as Popeye dipping in the spinach too

Take my nuts out your mouth
Let me breathe for a minute please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You're on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine, free the mind, lead the blind, read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out cuz I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick, no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper. Hit her in the pooper. Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower, make the pussy brand new
Ran through. Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox & burn her with the candle

9.24.13 Lyrics
Uh
Waxy
Smoking that Barbara Walters wax
Same fucking outfit twenty days in a row I don’t give a shit

You only came around ‘cause you thought I had some money for you
You got it fucked up
That’s for the kids
And If there’s anything left I’ll cop a crib
And If there’s anything left after that I’ll cop a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates?
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted, trying to erase her name
No, I caught her cheating, her pussy didn’t feel the same
She was probably with one of the Broncos
Or LeBron so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up, nah
I can’t talk about that though…
Your chance is thin like the moustache of Puerto Ricans
Shooting guns with my daughter on the weekend
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker *laughs
Fuck
Fuck man
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Uh
Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Hit him with stacks
Showed him the gat like ‘you gonna miss the finger roll right’
Fuck
I Told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Showed him some stacks
Then showed him the gat like ‘you're gonna miss the finger roll right?’
Yes Mr. Baklava
Then I cartwheeled into a aqua car

*trails into laughter
Shit!
Its too crazy right?
Yo
Its just fucking nuts
We just talking crazy at this point

I told the driver Lenny swing me by the garden I gotta talk to Pat
Showed him some stacks
Then showed him the gat like ‘you're gonna miss the finger roll right?’
Yes, Mr. Baklava
Then I cartwheeled into and aqua car
Now I’m, sliding
Ma, your boy has made it, no more
Crying
The facial reminiscent of a lion
Fuck around I’ll send you back to zion
And I ain't even trying
Swing the wood wheel like lumberjacks
I remember back when they wouldn’t spend a stack on my rap
Now they want to wipe my ass in the crack after I shat
And I just had corn beef hash
Ew…

Pouches of Tuna Lyrics

Bronsolino, damn
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna-
I ain't like that one
Yo, line for line
Straight up lambs on the arm, Giambi lenses
Ken Caminiti, Bosworth
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer
Bending these young Lola Fellanas over. Ace the test
Baste the breast with the juices
Under the influence of fly shit, I glide like Ovechkin
Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest
Baby girl, you're wylin if you sniff this
You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets
Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand
Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam in the can
Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos
Eating tacos, higher than a opera note
We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics
I throw you in that armbar with the quickness
Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45. fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china
Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er
I hit the diner, the Carolina
Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder
Vagina splash like apple cider
So fuck your little 2 cents blue benz bitches jump like Harold Miner
I'm in the recliner, we traced like eye liner
And I escape like MacGyver
Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler
And lay up with a case of vodka
Get cake and prosper
Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra
Air you out, leave your face for pasta
Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster
Beige fox, 88 Clarks
Ladies identify gangsters' posture
I'm feeling like J Hoffa
Fuck yall, eat a fat dick with the monsterYou might also like6Embed
 
 
 
 
A Light in the Addict Lyrics

Sittin' first class, feelin' like shit though
Starin' out the window with the mind of a schizo
Thinkin' if I jump, will I feel it when I hit the ground?
Fuck that, I want the crown off anybody head
I wouldn't care if everybody's dead
It's why I keep the pump shotty layin' in the bed
Have a fuckin' sleepover with my weapons
My Rambo knife is eatin' nuggets with my Smith & Wesson
Shit, I made this out of nothin'
Damn, these ladies love me out in London
Laurenivici served the granulated onion
My mind is locked in a contaminated dungeon
Dog, what the fuck is with your mother?
She got one leg longer than the other
One eye through the shutter
Made the transition from weed to butter, like spring to summer
I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I nearly lost my mind
All a motherfucker got is time, time, time
Time, time
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so glad
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain, so bad
So bad, I'm so gladYou might also like20Embed
 
 
 
 
Shiraz LyricsWe've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain inside the coupe
Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid
Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in Corona, bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu no ta pa mi, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert, can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
FILA jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going "Boom Shakalaka!" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, cuz
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco, take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you
Bye, peace, one, fuck youYou might also like10Embed
 
 
 
 
Contemporary Man Lyrics
Get it together Justin, got to get it together fam
Let's go
Yeah, fuck the back talk
Save all that pussy shit for the cat walk
Now write your name 100 times on the blackboard
Just a white man excelling in a Black sport, like I'm Pistol Pete
You already know you a goner when I kiss your cheek
Lift your feet, like when your sister sweeps
Fine dining, drink water out the crystal creek
Straight from Queens rocking leathers like I'm Mr. Cheeks
Uhhhh, fly shit
Grown man shit
Do it one more time, fuck it
I'm good to go
Alright

Yo, I'm a wild freak, hit shorty where the child sleep
While her mother make soup with the cow feet
Shoulder pads and a leather, Beau Brummell
Hopping out the limo at the old Tunnel
Fuck sex on the beach, I want head in the streets
Spread bed on the feet
Lead on your cheek, the cadillac from 73
Aqua marine with a popular fiend, uhh
Big Bird, Farrington alumnus
Mouth like a pussy, she gum dick

You see me in the green velour, facial conquistador
Then I order up a feast for four
If you see me in a leather, know it's reaching the floor
Linen flapping in the wind cause of the breezy shore, yeah
Spinal tap, you spitting gynecology rap
Eat your pussy with a plastic bag, covering that
Brothers will clap leave you hovered or jacked
If there's chicken in the building, know I'm smothering that
This tool I got will loosen up your stool a lot
Near the pee pee will make you poo-poo a lot
In the Z3 bumping U2

Yo, this Big motherfucking Body, bitch

Ginger ale laying in a Knicks cup
Pay thirty dollars for a dick suck
Pay a hundred dollars for the joints I rolled
Oyster bowls chilling in the cloisters
I love Black girls boisterous
Shorty's on the arm like a koi fish
On a herby white dude with the yellow fever
Yellow sneakers, see through yellow beeper

Banging seven gram rocks and finishing them
Because that’s how I roll, I have one speed, I have one gear

Yeah, uh-huh
Feel the beat…

When our eyes first met, was like the fourth day in July
When you kissed my lips, I knew one day you'd be mine

Watch my shorty take a shower, I want the good loving
Six ducks in a wood burning oven
Georgia Southern, her alma mater
She raised out in Queens, but moved out to Colorado
Looney Tunes, Taz on the shirt
Fuck swag, got pizzazz
Two jags, Cincinnati Zubaz
Du rag, Bay Terrace pool pass
Talked to Skip, schooled me on the ponies
Next year catch me posing at the Tonys
Folding paper wilding at the OTB
Grow the money like a Cocha tree
American flags hang on walls that hide money
Put my arm through the Picasso
Kept a fortress, crib got the Tex-Mex motif, wolves howling
Two stallions pull the buggy, Clydesdale
Crack the Bud, guzzle, humidors
Uncle Moozy with the Mitsubishi
Uncle Jimmy with the funny money flossing out in AC
Randy Quaid with the turtleneck
Erma with the jungle juice, man feet
Beamer, tan seats
Smack the taco out your mouth, green couch11Embed
 
 
 
 
Rolling Thunder Lyrics
Aw man, smoking in that rocking chair, uh

My past life I was a Rabbi, now I live the fast life
Drugs on standby in the circle by the campfire
Telling stories of yesteryear
Pull out the pocket mirror just to check my hair
Hit it with the comb again
The rap Dennis the Menace with Dennis Rodman's in Venice, inventive
She took a bump and started dancing like Elaine Benes
The big chain sway like I’m playing tennis
One man team, about to win the pennant
Now you can tell by my pendant that I’m protected
Direct descendent in the blue and orange Lexus watching ‘Se7en'
Land in Dublin
Pull me in the room and ask if its resin
I said no, they sent me on my way with blessings
I trained a dolphin to let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren
That’s if your mouth running, you’ll get your couch sunked in
I’m rare like a fucking Asian playing hockey
My ocean view is due to Papi
Bitches call me Rodney
Bought my bitch a present hope I don’t spoil it
‘What is it baby?’
Face to face toilets
Toyota with the spoiler Ace of Base boiling
I play ball like Billy Hoyle
Now I need a Sidney Dean to help me start this brothel in the Philippines
I stay in Flushing like I’m Dillon Gee
You ain't gotta open the comic book to figure who the villain be
It’s me doing perfect dives in the Sicilian sea
You know I like my bitch with a Brazilian V
Bumping Bobby Brown
Cry when I’m not around
She always hold it down, pound under the seat
In that all white Jeep sleep, that’s if you wanna
I be schwitzing in the sauna
It's better than the piggies blitzing on the corner
Come in the crib every night, and I kiss my daughter
Same lips spit on the lawyer
*spitting noise

Imported Goods Lyrics
 Oh my god, this mothafuckin' sour is too good
I don’t even be fuckin' with that other shit
That shit hurts my throat man
I need that shit that tastes like fuckin', fuckin' soap
Joy, Ajax. Shit… ayo, this is what I be doin' on that…

Orlando Magic warm-up suits and black Shaqs
'95: younger Bronson on the fast track
To blast gat, now I'm looking past that
I want the cash stack higher than the NASDAQ
I put the work in, the downtime I'm cooking lamb
A thousand Dutches in the air like it's a reefer jam
Aretha jam, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me
Or risk the forest where the motherfucking rest your team be
Peking duck, and large liver, goose carver
Swiss Bally's, smoke cigar just like a new father
You know the motto, jacket to the knee
I can't help if I'm a fiend, I had to tap into the beat, Lord
Spark a seance, cause everybody lifted
I'm like the strainer with the fucking powder being sifted up
This is Queens Day, alleys where the fiends play
Yo cuff the Guess on the construction, take it easy
This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home, and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight, focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies

Bronsonelli the problem, we got the party reeking
Never see us starving, all my people hardly speaking
When it's time, though, we form into a single file
Spray the fucking ballcourt without hitting a single child
Hop in the Beamer, Pigeon popping the nina
Getting top in a steamer, scoping rock in a Tina
Hooker, that type of looker eat the pussy from the back
Take the children to the school, baking cookies, serving packs all day
Know the verbal, is Oscar-winning
You cop a squat to piss in, only focused on them rocks that glisten
Suppositories in the ass of you, the green Fila with a Horsey how this motherfucking bastard do
Bet the crib that you ain't fucking with this grown man
I'll E. Honda a thousand, slap you with the whole hand
Sex a dime, herbally, a blessed time

The eyes slanted from the origami, I roll a quarter of the water
Near the border, where you oughta find me
The Tamborine Man pumping while the Tyson burning
Air Tech Challenge, clay court, checks balance
Stay endorsing that weak shit, my team spit
That mean shit, like stepping in some fiend's shit
Now you sick to your stomach because you stunted
Word got fronted, another motherfucking jerk confronted
Post pattern, Lonnie threw the loaf at 'em
Flushing, motherfucker, keep a toast up by the gold Saturn
Little doulas on the block we tell 'em "go stab 'em"
Relieve him of his shoes, it's easier to toe tag 'em'
Carhartt sets and Horseys like the Preakness
Bronson love a freak bitch, dining on that Greek dish
That's the a-hole, all my people AWOL
Cash inside the case and now the judges want to play ball

Through The Eyes of a G Lyrics
I think I got 15...bullshit, this is nothing. Look, my feet hurt, I need DOPE. What are we gonna do Sebastian, cause I got, I need piles of money. Forget this shit...but a hit of crack will do for now

Yeah...through the eyes of a G
Through the eyes of a G, see me in the all white Eclipse
A husband pay me 10 stacks to fuck his bitch
Hand up her ass like a Muppet baby, it's crazy
While she do a buck-eighty in a mustard Mercedes
I move the mustard from Russia to Haiti
Forty-fives will kiss your neck like the touch from a lady
Fuck with my lunch and then the pump leaves you under the daisies
You know your bitch is just another cocksucker with rabies
I'm signing autographs in Spanish, I live with Michael Jackson's anguish
Hop in the Vanquish and vanish off the manor in a strange manner
Aim the hammer at your dame's bladder, like it ain't matter
I smoke 'til I got down syndrome
Tan gators, brown linen
Multi-color money, seven different kinds of cheeses
My silhouette resembles Jesus in all seasons
Take a ginger shot, doing concentration curls with the cinderblocks
Doing squats, hope the ox don't drop out
Don't make me have to slap the fire out your pop's mouth
It's me...uh
Through the eyes of a G

Yo
Through the eyes of a G
A-B, utilize what you and I use to see
To move forward
Cause I get bored with niggas talking 'bout
Who they used to be, what they used to do
My homie headed to court, not for a 2-on-2
Ironically, I'll have you know we do it for the sport
Or at least to keep a little gold in this uniform
I'm abnormal like a unicorn that you could get on
Cows jump over moons when my nouns and verbs move
Etiquette of a veteran, still getting checks
You get a F for your efforts, we never trade techs
I tried to keep the peace but now I gotta keep the piece
I speak in synchronistic frequency with triggers squeezing
And one day I'll drop to my knee and repent to Jesus
'Til then I'm humping my lust demons for no reason
Soul-o ho, from Del Amo to SoHo, ho
Yo, yo, check, "you do not know me, no, no, no
You do not know me but I know you-"

Alligator Lyrics
Baby my ride so clean, I ride so dirty
I'm about to buy an alligator for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where you been?", don't worry
She said, "Baby I crashed the Benz", don't worry
I ride so clean, my ride so dirty
I'm about to buy a fucking Lion for my birthday
My girl asking me, "Where I been?" don't worry
She said, "Baby, I crashed the Benz", don't worry

Dropkicks out the drop-top 6
Don't make your fucking kid become a hostage, I got this
Stay in the water like the Loch Ness
Shirtless rocking a locket
Drugs in my pocket
It's all for a profit
Aim it and pop it, drive in a range in my boxers
Lay in the tropics, my girl pussy red like a lobster
Orgies at Hofstra
My bank account is like a Polish doctor
My heart is cold, I sing a soldiers opera
My drugs as strong as Arnold
They found her dead in the gold Impala
Hanging backwards out the chopper
The room smell like Nag Champa
Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers

Yeah, I rhyme sick like I play with shit
I've driven every flavored whip there is to get
Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff
I should be on that Sped Ed bus, layin' on the bed with a red head slut
These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it
I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing Sega
Prince of Albania
No money, nothing to say to ya
I push the limo to the stadium
Game 7, Knicks-Heat
Me and Spike had to switch seats
Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet
Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet
Down in Mexico eating chilis


No emotions, lotions on the bed sheets
I saw her walking cause I'm stalking on the dead streets
Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet
She had a tight pink dress, her pussy was a weapon
Said she was a daughter of a Reverend
Well, thank god I don't believe in heaven
Butt cheeks sculpted like a horse's hind
Shit man, I think that I just crossed the line
Annual abortion time
Yeah, she got the tat straight from West 4th
Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off
And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough
Well I'm not a doctor, but I know that's not a good sign
Matter of time 'til she placed and laced in a wood pine
For years she was the hood slime
Now no longer having a good time
Under earth, she burst into a sudden birth
Oh shit, the facial of my cousin Murph
Strange occurrences, alignment with the sun and earth, yeah
As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning
Instinctively they heading towards the water cause they need it
Forever cycles stay the same, they feel it like a fiend's wrist
Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship
My mustache like a Colonel
Take a haters facial and I treat it like a urinal
A bit disturbed, confessions in a journal
I'm sickened by my thoughts so it's tossed in the infernoYou might also like6Embed
 
 
 
 
Falconry Lyrics

Yo pass me the ball fool
You better fuckin' pick me, ya
Straight the fuck up, I roof this shit
Fuckin' 360 on this pussy
I don't give a fuck
I'll kick this motherfucking ball over the fence
No shoes on
I know you see me on the TV, lookin' like a hunk of beef
When I smile your baby mama shit her dungarees
Somebody get the kid a deal he sound like me
But nah, dunny don't get down like me
The falcon flies back to the glove when I whistle
Don't try to put me in the box like a tissue
Cause I push you in the box with a pink suit
Fuck around and have some squid ink soup, bitch
(Ah man there's so much fuckin' hash in this joint right now son)
Uh, you ain't a legend like Yanni
I'm so Queens like a Roy Wilkins T-shirt
With one arm shredded, and one arm missing
Dog, I was born with Allah's vision
I learned quick I couldn't follow suit
Cause the Devil put the pork inside the dollar soup
Now I'm sittin' in first class with a hard dick
Listenin' to German guitar riffs, what a life
I was made like the beginning of Jurassic Park
When they took the fucking blood from the mosquito with a dope needle
Then they shot it in a wild lion, 1983
I popped out holdin' an iron with a visor on
Yeah, uh huh
Yo, the videos are like a Jewish summer camp promo
Your ideas lack Adobo

Yo, silk cinder blocks, cinnamon socks

Representative for everything official
Ya'll niggas can't live, so it's officially an issue
Waterproof penmanship, padded on a rugby
Hammer in the hamper 'case a nigga try to thug me
I'm a idol, my wave is tidal, forget survival
Treat the last record I broke just like a rival
Uh, I'm New York before it turned into a bike lane
Never had a light fame, split the pipe cane
It was written but I wrote it
Put religion right on my neck and then I froze it
Laurenovitch, yeah

3:36 in the morning
Location: a drug infested area, Brooklyn, New York
What am I doing? Standing on an unidentified corner
With a Latin individual, corn rows, foamposites;
All sorts of a felony in his waist
But who are you? She only loves me when I'm naked12Embed
 
 
 
 
Brunch Lyrics
{Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me}
You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break north
Before you six south and I'll be sitting in that big house

Just let me sharpen my knives, thrown on the apron
X's mark the steak and the salad crumbled with bacon
And bleu cheese, caramel complexion's on two knees
Or two skis, carving up the Alps is what this dude needs
I'm Rick the Model, Martel to cartel
Live fast and eat the big tuna like Billy Parcells
No more child's play kid you with the big boys
Fuck an economy size, we want that big Royce
My family's sayin' that I rhyme with fury
Only focus on them hundred bill faces and suitcases that'll bribe a jury
Grind the curry never shine the jewelry
Pussy like it 86 style, you know it's fine and furry
Spark the bark in the park, you know, lumberyard
You ain't never in the limelight, undercard
Bronsolini in the sky, thunder rod
Commandante of this rap shit, young Mossad, killer
{Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me}
You say goodbye to me bitch, you better break north
Before you six south and I'll be sitting in that big house

The second stanza even deadly than the first
From the birth, I've been enlisted to plant seeds in the earth
That's soon, road to a valley that feeds, civilization
I'm walking the torrid land though I'm seeking my vindication from
My bad, I'll keep it fifth grade, keep the switchblade
Hilfiger sailin' apparel and plus a crisp fade
First day class, the Agassis are black and white
My older cousin puffing pot bitch, pass the pipe
Now I'm a certified user, more like abuser
Slice and dice the music I'm fluid like the yakuza
Or Sanders whether Deion or Barry, find candy
Though I smoke until my eyes are the shape of Tia Carrere
My team we work as a unit, nobody hog the ball up
Great intuition and vision, no time to hit the mall up
Just a taste of the life like a September call up
Johnnie Walker in our tall cup, getting torn up
Listen, I'm steel fisted with the iron lung
Heavy metal ballads out the guitar where lions run
Praise the son that can stand on his own two
Smoke on the big blunt, take a sip of this home-brew
